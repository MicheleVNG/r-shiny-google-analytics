# r-shiny-google-analytics
A shiny app for pulling data from Google Analytics and providing user control over what gets displayed.
This code requires a Google Analytics API client ID and client secret, as well as access to at least
one Google Analytics account (and at least one API view ID for the account).

NOTE: This code was written by someone who is *very* new to R. The code itself includes some comments
noting where cleanup is warranted or where there is uncertainty as to whether the code is even needed.
